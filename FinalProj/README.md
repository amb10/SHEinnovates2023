## What is "What's My Expiration?"
"What's My Expiration?" is a web application that counts inventory for food banks and tracks food expiration dates for the average person.  Implementing python, HTML, and CSS, this application uses object oriented programming to create several classes to update grocery lists, allergies of users, and send alerts to maintain food banks and kitchens.  While shoppers have access to features such as expiration trackers and grocery lists, food bank adminstrators can access inventory of food banks, shipment alerts, and the date food items were received as well as all features available to shoppers.

## Why Use What's My Expiration?
"What's My Expiration?" is a multi-use platform that combines reminders related to food items for the average household while also creating use for food banks.  While there are platforms that have certain features of this application towards simply expiration dates, this web application combines many of the uses found on singular websites and creates a unique experience for food banks to track their inventory.  We have found the need to track when our food expires to avoid waste of resources as it often becomes difficult to track the needed resources in households and food banks alike.
